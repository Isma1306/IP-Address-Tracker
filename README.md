## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - JS library



### What I learned

I have learned the basics of SCSS and how to implement them to Angular.
Also, how to use and set leaflet to make a good looking map.
Finally I tried to manage all the information on the services and only used the components with the async pipe to make them as simple as possible.


### Useful resources

- [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/)
- [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5284147/validating-ipv4-addresses-with-regexp) - here I found hwo to filter ip addresses from domains with regex. Very interesting discussion.
